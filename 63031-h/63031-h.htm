<h2 class="nobreak" id="BORLUM">BORLUM.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Long</span> ago—you may say in 1808—when I was a
boy at Peebles, the school-children, as a variety
in their boisterous amusements, occasionally bombarded
with stones a grievously defaced effigy
built into the walls of a ruinous old church in the
neighbourhood. With savage significance, the unfortunate
piece of sculpture was called Borlum,
and as Borlum it had been pelted by several successive
generations. From the dearth of historical
knowledge at the spot, no one could explain who
or what was meant by Borlum; and not till some
years afterwards, in the course of reading, did I
find out that by Borlum was meant Brigadier
Mackintosh of Borlum, who commanded a resolute
party of Highlanders in Mar’s rebellion of 1715,
and who, by their masterly audacity in marching
towards the Border, threw the southern counties
of Scotland into a state of indescribable alarm.
To Borlum, as he was familiarly termed, was thus
assigned the character of a bugbear along the
whole course of the Tweed; and long after he had
passed away, and when the political events in
which he was concerned were forgotten, the original
terror of his name survived in the vengefully
destructive recreations of school-children. In a
vicarious capacity, a harmless piece of sculpture,
which had nothing at all to do with Borlum, was
doomed to suffer for a popular scare nearly a
hundred years previously.</p>

<p>In the history of that miserably managed affair,
Mar’s Jacobite rebellion, Mackintosh of Borlum—or
more properly <i>younger</i> of Borlum, for his father
was still living—stands conspicuously out as a
military hero, who threw into the shade many
of higher title and pretensions. How with five
hundred of his clan, with banners flying, he
marched to Inverness, and seized that important
post. How he hastened on to the Lowlands,
eluded the troops designed to intercept him;
crossed the Firth of Forth with a large force in
open boats, and captured Leith. How, carrying
everything before him, he marched onwards to
the Border, in order to join the rebel forces of
General Forster in Northumberland—are all facts
belonging to history. His sagacity, foresight, intrepidity,
and daring courage were worthy of a better
cause. Getting into England, and mixed up with
half-hearted movements, Borlum is very much lost
sight of. The enterprise, owing to Mar’s indiscretion,
had been shockingly ill considered. The
English Jacobites failed to rise in a body, as they
were justified in doing, for the auxiliaries which
had been expected from France never made their
appearance; and the whole thing collapsed, as is
well known, by the humiliating capture of the
insurgents by General Carpenter at Preston, in
Lancashire. Surrendering at discretion, the whole
were conducted as prisoners to London—Borlum
among the rest. A dreadful downcome to the
proud Highland chief, but not more so than to
Lords Derwentwater, Winton, Nithsdale, Kenmure,
Carnwath, Widdrington, and other Jacobite
noblemen.</p>

<p>It is not altogether agreeable to look back on
the dynastic struggles which took place in England
in the first half of the eighteenth century; for
with some redeeming traits of character, they give
a very mean view of human nature. The subject
has been suggested to us by the appearance of a
work which many will appreciate for its lively
account of scenes and circumstances hitherto imbedded
in the dry records of history. We mean
<i>London in the Jacobite Times</i>, by Dr Doran, F.S.A.
(2 vols. Bentley and Son). The writer, it is
sorrowful to learn, passed away before the work
at which he had long patiently laboured had
well been published; and we regret that he has
not survived to hear the praises bestowed on his
endeavours to produce a picture of past times such
as is rarely presented. The way the subject is
treated is quite unique. Instead of going into
regular historical details, which would be alike
tedious and tiresome, the author writes in a sketchy
and anecdotic style without pause from beginning
to end, and we have before us a drama of unflagging
interest, extending over the greater part of
a century. We do not think, however, that the
book would have been the worse of a few preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>{210}</span>
remarks on the strange circumstances
by which the Stuarts forfeited the crown, and
placed themselves in the grotesquely unhappy
condition of kings retired from business.</p>

<p>The flight of James II. from England, and
practically his abdication of authority, December
22, 1688, finished the house of Stuart. When
a king runs away from his subjects, and stupidly
flings down a magnificent inheritance, he has a
bad chance of being called back again, particularly
when by a course of exasperating and illegal
conduct he has forfeited general esteem. Yet,
from the date of that fatal flight there were successive
plots by Jacobite adherents to bring
back the Stuarts to the throne. Throughout the
reign of William III. and of Queen Anne, the
plottings were of a comparatively obscure character.
On the death of Anne in 1714, and
the installation of George I. under a parliamentary
Act of Settlement, came the crisis. The
rebellion of 1715 broke out, and being quenched
at Preston, the fierce dissensions of Jacobites and
Whigs arose. Dr Doran commences his narrative
with the death of Anne, but scarcely awakes to
his subject till the droves of rebels from Preston
enter London and are dispersed through the
various prisons, the more noble of them being
conducted to the Tower.</p>

<p>While preserving the forms of law, the government
did not put off time in the examination and
trials of the captured rebels. The pulpits rang
with sermons condemnatory of their crimes. Joseph
Addison, in his paper the <i>Freeholder</i>, railed upon
them with indecent subserviency. There was no
want of evidence to convict the leading spirits
in the insurrection; but matters were considerably
simplified by the voluntarily proffered testimony
of the Rev. Robert Patten, who had been formerly
a curate at Preston, and acted as chaplain to the
rebel forces. Clapped into prison with his associates,
Patten pondered on the best means of escaping
the gallows; and the longer he thought of it, he
became the more firmly convinced that his best
plan was to become king’s evidence. His testimony
was accepted; and at the cost of being
branded throughout all time as a rascal, he daily
stood up in court and told every particular requisite
to convict the unhappy noblemen and gentlemen
with whom he had been associated, and
whose bread he had eaten. Very much through
the testimony of this wretch, the prisons were gradually
cleared by the exit of batches of convicts
on hurdles to Tyburn. The Tower was similarly
relieved of two of its noble inmates, Derwentwater
and Kenmure, who perished on the scaffold; and
there would have been more of them, but for
the escape of the Earl of Nithsdale disguised in
his wife’s clothes, and for the fortunate reprieve
of the Lords Widdrington, Nairn, and Carnwath.
On the evening of the day on which
the Earl of Derwentwater was beheaded (24th
February 1716), London was thrown into a state
of commotion by the appearance in the sky of
an extraordinary Aurora, in which there were
fancied resemblances of armies, flaming swords,
and fire-breathing dragons—the Jacobites accepting
the phenomenon as a token of the indignation
of Heaven at the cruel murders on Tower Hill,
and prognosticating the rise of the sun of Stuart!
On the estates of the Earl of Derwentwater, this
famed aurora was called the ‘Earl of Derwentwater’s
Lights;’ and it is said that an aurora is
still so named in the vicinity of Dilston.</p>

<p>The government of George I. had some difficulty
in dealing with the Earl of Wintoun, who contrived
to get his trial put off as long as possible, on the
plea that he was not yet prepared with his evidence.
The truth is, the earl was a somewhat
eccentric being. In his youth he had run away
from his home at Seton House, went to France,
and hired himself to work as a blacksmith. Returning
at the death of his father, when everybody
had given him up for lost, he assumed the title,
George fifth Earl of Wintoun, and was living
quietly at Seton when the rebellion broke out. He
had no wish to connect himself with it; but stung
by some outrageous proceedings of the authorities,
he joined the insurrection, and so got himself into
trouble. When brought to the bar of the House
of Lords, there was some surprise at the oddity of
his behaviour. Whether from cunning or affectation,
he did not seem to understand why his trial
should be hurried on, though in reality he might
have complained of the delay. All the earl’s
shifts did not greatly serve him. Patten, on being
questioned, said that he had seen the Earl of
Wintoun on several occasions with a drawn sword
in his hand when the Pretender was proclaimed.
After this, of course Wintoun was found guilty, and
condemned to be beheaded. Not a pleasant drive
from Westminster Hall to the Tower, accompanied
by the Gentleman Gaoler, ceremoniously carrying
an axe with its edge turned towards the condemned
earl. One feels a degree of satisfaction in
knowing that after all the Earl of Wintoun escaped
his doom. Confined to an apartment in the Tower
preparatory to the morning of execution, he brought
his knowledge as a blacksmith into play by cutting
through the iron bars of his window by files
supplied by his servant, and dropping to the ground
got clear off. He died at Rome in 1749, his title
and estates being meanwhile forfeited. The title
has been latterly revived in favour of the Earls of
Eglintoun. But with the disappearance of the last
of the Setons in the direct line, an ancient and
honourable family was blotted from the Scottish
peerage.</p>

<p>Mackintosh of Borlum—called by mistake Borland
by Dr Doran—was confined along with General
Forster and a host of others in Newgate. Borlum
and Forster are stated to have often quarrelled
regarding the military conduct of the insurrection,
their angry debates often furnishing amusement in
the corridors, court-yard, and common room in the
prison, to which visitors were admitted without
hinderance, as to a tavern, for the more eating and
drinking there were the better it was for Mr Pitt,
the governor. Pitt, himself, was never disinclined to
lend his assistance in eating a dinner, or in finishing
a bowl of punch. So countenanced, the revelries
in Newgate were boundless. Dr Doran affords
a glimpse of this state of things. Visitors and
sympathisers supplied the prisoners with money.
‘While it was difficult to change a guinea almost
at any house in the street, nothing was more easy
than to have silver for gold in any quantity, and
gold for silver, in the prison; those of the fair sex,
from persons of the first rank to tradesmen’s wives
and daughters, making a sacrifice of their husbands’
and parents’ rings and other precious movables for
the use of the prisoners. The aid was so reckless,
that forty shillings for a dish of early peas and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>{211}</span>
beans, and thirty shillings for a dish of fish, with
the best French wine, was an ordinary regale!’</p>

<p>Forster was to be tried on the 18th April, but a
week previously the town was startled with the
intelligence that he had broken bounds; he was off.
‘His escape,’ says Doran, ‘was well planned and
happily executed. His sharp servant found means
to obtain an impression of Pitt’s master-key, from
which another key was made and conveyed to
Forster, without difficulty. Pitt loved wine, and
Forster seems to have had a cellar full of it. He
often invited the governor to get drunk on its
contents. One night, Pitt got more drunk than
usual, finished the wine, and roared for more.
Forster bade his servant to fetch up another bottle.
This was the critical moment. The fellow was
long, and Forster declared he would go and see
what the rascal was at. On going, he locked the
unconscious Pitt in the room; and the way being
prepared by his servant, and turnkeys, as it would
seem, subdued by the “oil of palms,” master and
servant walked into the street, where friends
awaited them. Pitt sounded the alarm, but everything
had been well calculated. A smack lay at
Holly Haven, on the Thames, which had often
been employed by the Jacobites in running between
England and France.’ By this means,
Forster effected his escape, and ‘the joy of the
Jacobites was incontrollable.’ The government
shut up Pitt in one of his own dungeons, and
offered a thousand pounds for the recovery of
‘General Forster;’ but pursuit was useless. The
general was safe in France.</p>

<p>Borlum, who knew that his trial would speedily
take place, meditated on plans for emulating
the success of Forster. Strange to say, notwithstanding
a knowledge of the irregularities that
were carried on in Newgate, the public authorities
made no change in the administration of affairs.
Wine flowed, punch was sent round, and the
prisoners suffered scarcely any stint in their
indulgences. Things were indeed rather worse
than better—all which was favourable to a plan
concocted by Borlum and his fellow-captives.
‘The prisoners,’ says Dr Doran, ‘might cool themselves
after their drink, by walking and talking,
singing and planning, in the court-yard, till within
an hour of midnight. Evil came of it. On the
night of the 4th [May] the feast being over, nearly
five dozen of the prisoners were walking about the
press-yard. Suddenly, the whole body of them
made an ugly rush at the keeper with the keys.
He was knocked down, the doors were opened,
and the prisoners swept forth to freedom. All,
however, did not succeed in gaining liberty. As
the attempt was being made, soldiers and turnkeys
were alarmed. The fugitives were then driven in
different directions. Brigadier Mackintosh, his son,
and seven others overcame all opposition. They
reached the street, and they were so well befriended,
or were so lucky, as to disappear at once, and to
evade all pursuit. They fled in various directions.’
Some others less fortunate were secured, ‘and were
not only heavily ironed and thrust into loathsome
holes, but treated with exceptional brutality.’
What a picture of a metropolitan prison in the
reign of George I.!</p>

<p>The escape of Borlum from Newgate with certain
other convicts produced an immense sensation.
For decency’s sake, if for nothing else, the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen came down to the prison,
and solemnly gathered some evidence on the subject.
The least thing in the way of amends was
to offer a reward for the capture of ‘William Mackintosh,
commonly called Brigadier Mackintosh.’
Placards were profusely posted up describing the
appearance of Borlum. ‘A tall, raw-boned man,
about sixty years of age, fair complexioned, beetle-browed,
gray-eyed, speaks broad Scotch.’ The
reward for capturing him was two hundred pounds,
to which sum, however, were added a thousand
pounds by the government. Every effort failed to
secure the old Highland chief. He and his son
succeeded in getting on board a vessel in the
Thames, by which they reached the coast of France,
and there for the present we must leave him.</p>

<p>These furtive escapes did not slacken operations
at Tyburn, to which doomed men from Newgate
were carried in half-dozens, as if for a public entertainment.
We can hardly in the present day
realise the brutality of these exhibitions, to which,
however, ladies of quality regularly adjourned to
see the show. Hanging formed a holiday amusement
of the fashionable society of London. Such
was the disregard of humane feeling that officers of
the law were not ashamed to practise cruel deceptions
on convicts at the very scaffold. Dr Doran
describes a case of this kind. It was that of a
person named David Lindsay, convicted of traitorous
visits to France, who was sentenced to die, and
carted to Tyburn in spite of an amnesty. ‘When
his neck was in the noose, the sheriff tested
David’s courage, by telling him he might yet
save his life on condition of revealing the names of
alleged traitors. David, however sorely tempted,
declined to save his neck on such terms. Thereupon,
the sheriff ordered the cart to drive on; but
even this move towards leaving Lindsay suspended
did not shake his stout spirit. All this time the
sheriff had a reprieve for the unnecessarily tortured
fellow in his pocket. Before the cart was fairly
from under Lindsay’s feet, it was stopped, or he
would have been murdered.’ Taken back alive to
Newgate, a very unusual spectacle, Lindsay, after
being nearly starved in a loathsome dungeon, was
sent into perpetual banishment; ultimately he died
of hunger and exposure in Holland.</p>

<p>As the hanging of some thousands of rebels
would have shocked ordinary decency, vast numbers
were condemned to be banished, as an act of
grace, to the Plantations, or were ‘made over as
presents to trading courtiers,’ who might pardon
them for ‘a consideration.’ Think of lords and
ladies at court being presented with groups of
convicts on whom money could be made by
selling pardons! The fact throws a new light on
this period of English history. As regards transportation,
Dr Doran gives some not uninteresting
and little known particulars concerning Rob Roy.
Twelve years after the rebellion of 1715, Rob was
taken to London in connection with the Disarmament
Act, and sentenced with many others to be
transported to Barbadoes. Handcuffed to Lord
Ogilvie, he was marched from Newgate through
the streets of London to a barge at Blackfriars, and
thence to Gravesend. ‘This,’ says Dr Doran, ‘is
an incident which has escaped the notice of
Walter Scott and of all Rob’s biographers.’ Before
quitting England, the barge-load of convicts were
pardoned and allowed to return home.</p>

<p>Matters had considerably calmed down, when
the country was startled with the rebellion which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>{212}</span>
broke out in 1745, headed by the young Chevalier,
Charles Edward, grandson of James II. It was
a daring and romantic adventure, but as badly
conceived and supported as that of thirty years
previously. No promised auxiliaries were supplied
from France; and that the attempt to upset
a powerful and settled government by a handful
of adventurous Highlanders and the adherents of
a few discontented noblemen and gentry should
have ended disastrously, as it finally did on the
field of Culloden, is not at all surprising. This
fresh outbreak in the reign of George II. affords
new material for the graphic pen of Dr Doran;
and to his second volume we must refer for many
painful though curious details concerning the
treatment of the unfortunate prisoners. The
manners of the more fashionable classes in the
metropolis do not seem to have improved. We
are told that ‘people of fashion went to the Tower
to see the prisoners as persons of lower quality
went there to see the lions. Within the Tower, the
spectator was lucky who saw Murray [of Broughton],
Charles Ratcliffe, Lord Traquair, Lord Cromarty
and his son, and the Lord Provost, at their
respective windows. Lady Townshend, who had
fallen in love with Lord Kilmarnock, at the first
sight of “his falling shoulders,” when he appeared
to plead at the bar of the Lords, was to be seen
under his window at the Tower.’ The Lord
Provost, here alluded to, was Archibald Stewart,
who, known to be of Jacobite proclivities, was
charged with culpable neglect of duty, in having
allowed a party of Highlanders to rush in and
take possession of Edinburgh. Stewart was tried
and acquitted. Lord Cromarty’s life was spared;
but Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino, and Lovat
perished by beheading on Tower Hill. Lovat had
expressed a passionate desire to be buried with
his head in his own country in Scotland. The
wish was gratified. His head was sewed on again
by the undertaker before the body was despatched
northwards! Lord Traquair was liberated.</p>

<p>The case of Charles Ratcliffe was peculiar. He
was a younger brother of Lord Derwentwater
who was executed in 1716, and he had himself
only evaded the same fate at that time by being
one of the prisoners who escaped from Newgate
and took refuge in France. Assuming the title
of Earl of Derwentwater, he was made prisoner
in 1745, on board a French vessel on its way to
Scotland with supplies for Prince Charles. The
sentence of death which had been passed on him
thirty years before was now raked up. He was
condemned to be executed; and giving him the
benefit of his assumed title of nobility, he was
beheaded on Tower Hill, his manly courage and
proud bearing not deserting him at the last
dreadful scene.</p>

<p>Like Patten, in the former rebellion, Murray of
Broughton, who had acted as secretary to Charles
Edward, was saved by basely turning king’s
evidence, and sending many better men than himself
to the scaffold. He retreated into private
life under a deserved load of infamy. Years afterwards,
as we learn from Lockhart, Murray, several
times in disguise, visited Mr Scott, father of Sir
Walter, for the sake of professional advice. On
one of these occasions, Mrs Scott, from curiosity,
intruded with the offer of a cup of tea, which
Murray accepted. When he withdrew, Mr Scott
lifted the window-sash, and threw the empty cup
into the street. The lady exclaimed for her china,
but was silenced by the remark: ‘I may admit
into my house, on a piece of business, persons
wholly unworthy to be treated as guests by my
wife. Neither lip of me nor of mine comes after
Mr Murray of Broughton.’ As a memento of this
curious incident, Sir Walter made prize of the
saucer, which he preserved.</p>

<p>The executions of the untitled prisoners were
conducted in a wholesale manner on Kennington
Common, to which crowds flocked to see the
hideous show. Drawers attended to supply wine
to the culprits while the ropes were put round
their necks, for the Jacobites drank treasonous
toasts till the last. At one of these tragic ceremonials,
‘Captain Wood, after the halter was
loosely hung for him round his neck, called for
wine, which was supplied with alacrity by the
prison drawers. When it was served round, the
captain drank to the health of the rightful king,
James III.’ The slight delay so caused was lucky
for another culprit, Captain Lindsay, who was
coming up with a second batch. ‘While the wine
was being drunk, Lindsay was “haltering,” as the
reporters called it. He was nice about the look
of the rope, but just as he was courteously invited
to get in and be hanged, a reprieve came for him,
which saved his life.’ At this period, London
could not be deemed a pleasant place of residence
for any one with delicate feelings. The entrances
to the town were lined with decaying bodies
hanging in chains. At length the sights became
so offensive as to cause public remonstrance.</p>

<p>Dr Doran winds up his dramatic narrative with
some graceful remarks on the altered state of
feeling towards the Jacobites in the reign of
George III. By the decease of Charles Edward in
1788, after having sunk to the character of a sot,
the Jacobite fanaticism was considerably abated,
and only lingered as an expiring sentiment till
the death of Charles’s brother, Henry, Cardinal
York, 1807, when the house of Stuart was extinct.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to know that the royal family
always spoke with sympathy of the Stuarts.
Charles Edward, as is well known, was unhappy
in his marriage with Louise, Countess of Albany,
daughter of Count von Stolberg. She left him
for a convent in 1780, and subsequently to his
death became the wife of the Italian poet, Vittorio
Alfieri. By a strange turn in the wheel of fortune,
she sought an asylum in England, on the outbreak
of the French Revolution, and was well received
at the court in St James’s Palace, the king and
queen vying to do her honour. She went to see
the king in the House of Lords with the crown
on his head, when proroguing parliament, 1791.
Hannah More speaks of seeing the Countess of
Albany on that occasion seated among ladies ‘just
at the foot of the throne which she might once
have expected to have mounted.’ Finding London
dull, with ‘crowds but no society,’ and that the
climate of England did not suit her, she returned
to the continent.</p>

<p>In his latter years Cardinal York was supported
by a pension of four thousand pounds a
year from George III.; an act of kindness which
was handsomely responded to by the Cardinal
giving up to the king the crown diamonds
which James II. had carried away with him
to France. On the death of the Cardinal, the
Countess of Albany became the recipient of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>{213}</span>
annuity from the king. This she enjoyed till her
decease as plain Madame Fabre at Montpelier, in
France, in 1824. Such was the sorrowful ending
of the broken-down and much-tried widow of
Charles Edward Stuart.</p>

<p>We feel that our desultory sketch would be
incomplete without some account of Borlum subsequent
to his escape to France in 1716. For
any such account, however, there are very slender
materials in history. To a writer in the <i>Celtic
Magazine</i> (Inverness, 1877) we are indebted for
some of the following particulars. Borlum remained
in France only one or two years, during
which his father died, whereupon he became the
chief of his house. On what terms, if any, he was
allowed to return to his own country there is no
statement. At all events, he was again in Scotland
in 1719, for in that year he took part in the
mad attempt at insurrection by the aid of Spanish
soldiers, which was immediately stamped out.
That Mackintosh of Borlum should have engaged
in so wild an adventure, is an evidence of his
Jacobite fervour and indiscretion. He was once
more a fugitive, but for a time contrived to elude
detection. At length, he was apprehended in the
wilds of Caithness, and was conveyed as a state
prisoner to Edinburgh Castle.</p>

<p>Few, perhaps, among the gay crowds who throng
Princes Street, and cast a glance at the buildings
of the castle perched on the summit of rugged
cliffs, are aware that in one of these buildings, long
used as a state prison, poor Mackintosh of Borlum
was confined for the last years of his life. Certainly,
a hard fate for the old Jacobite! Cribbed
and confined in his airy but miserable den,
Borlum did not spend his time uselessly. Before
being involved in political troubles he had devoted
himself to the improvement and planting of lands.
He is said to have planted a row of trees which
still ornament the public road near Kingussie.
Now that he was locked up, he wrote an Essay on
the best means of inclosing and improving lands,
which was printed in Edinburgh in 1729. Our
authority adds: ‘On the 7th January 1743, after
a rough earthly pilgrimage of eighty years, the
gallant old soldier passed to his rest, true to the
last to the principles which had influenced his
whole life. One of his last acts, it is said, was to
dedicate one of his teeth to the service of his
exiled master, by writing with it on the wall of
his room an invocation of God’s blessing on King
James!’</p>

<p>How long Borlum was immured in that dismal
prison on the castle rock, is not clearly ascertained.
The obituary in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
speaks of his having been confined in the castle
‘fifteen years.’ By the authority above quoted, he
is said to have been imprisoned ‘for nearly a
quarter of a century.’ Truth may lie somewhere
between—from twenty to twenty-one years. The
<i>Caledonian-Mercury</i>, in noticing his decease at the
age of ‘about eighty-five,’ gives him a high character
as ‘a complete gentleman, friendly, agreeable,
and courteous;’ and for what he had written as
regards the improvement of land, he is to be
lastingly esteemed as ‘a lover of his country.’
Nowhere is a word said of the cruelty of
confining so aged and accomplished a person in
the worst species of prison till he was released
by death. For the seeming harshness of this
prolonged imprisonment, an excuse may perhaps
be found in the political apprehensions of the
period; but this scarcely lessens our compassion
for the sufferings of a man in so many respects
estimable. With all his faults, Borlum must be
admitted to have possessed that quality of earnestness
of purpose which in the ordinary concerns
of life is now so feebly demonstrated. It could
be wished that some one had done full justice to
his biography; for Borlum was undoubtedly one
of the most extraordinary men of his time.</p>

</div>


<h3>CHAPTER XIX.—FIRE!</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing so hard, nothing so difficult
as to get a governess nowadays,’ said the Countess
of Wolverhampton, quite unaware that she was
but echoing the complaint of many ladies of a
lesser degree, to the effect that it is next to impossible
to procure pattern cooks, prize housemaids,
exemplary seamstresses, or model kitchen-maids,
in these degenerate times. ‘I mean a really satisfactory
governess of course,’ added the noble
mistress of High Tor. Lady Wolverhampton and
her two elder daughters were the sole occupants
of the smallest of the suite of drawing-rooms, the
windows of which were yet open to admit the
balmy air of the hot evening. Dinner was but
just over, and the flush of the sinking sun was
faintly visible on the heathy ridges and pine-groves
to the west.</p>

<p>‘It is very tiresome, mamma,’ said sympathetic
Lady Maud.</p>

<p>‘It is more than tiresome,’ rejoined the Countess.
‘It makes me, on your sister’s account, very
anxious. If I had known, when Miss Grainger
left us, how very long it would take to replace
her, and that dear Alice would be for months
at a stand-still so far as her education went, I
should not have parted with her so readily.’</p>

<p>‘But she left us because she was going to be
married,’ said Lady Gladys smiling; ‘and we
could not, I suppose, have forbidden the banns on
account of the scarcity of good governesses. I
wonder, by the way, how the scarcity can exist,
when we are so perpetually informed that the
governess market—a phrase which I don’t like,
suggesting as it does white slavery, involuntary
servitude, and the auctioneer’s hammer—is overstocked.’</p>

<p>‘That sounds clever, Gladys,’ answered Lady
Wolverhampton in her plain way; ‘but I am
afraid that, like most clever-sounding things, it
proves nothing. I could get a highly certificated
instructress, a person primed with information
on particular subjects, warranted to be worth a
handsome salary, a’——</p>

<p>‘A teaching-machine, in fact,’ suggested bright
Lady Gladys, seeing that her mother hesitated
for the lack of a word.</p>

<p>‘Precisely. A teaching-machine,’ resumed the
Countess. ‘But I don’t want one. I wish Alice’s
governess, whoever she may be, to be a good
sensible young woman, such as Miss Grainger was;
and instead of that, all my correspondents write
to me of the degrees and diplomas that have been
taken out by those they recommend. I suppose
I am an old-fashioned person, but I do wish’——</p>

<p>But before the Countess of Wolverhampton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>{214}</span>
could complete her discourse on the governess
topic, the door was jerked open, and the old
butler, who had permitted himself to turn the
handle for once with such unconventional vivacity,
stood gasping in the doorway with a face as white
as his cravat.</p>

<p>‘Why, Bugles!’ began the Countess, rising in
alarm; for that an ox should talk, as Livy tells
us that a Roman representative of the bovine
genus actually did, is scarcely more calculated to
disturb the nerves than that a well-trained servant
should crack the ice of his artificial decorum.
The Earl, who was, like his wife, a partisan of
old fashions, was lingering over his wine in the
dining-room, and might of course be ill. Apoplexy
was the first thought that rose, like a
sheeted spectre, before the Countess’s mind.</p>

<p>‘Fire, my lady! Fire at High Tor; broke out
sudden; and all the village is in flames!’ panted
out Bugles the butler, who was fat and short of
breath. And without were to be vaguely heard
other voices and the sound of running feet, and
the cry, alarming above all others, of ‘Fire! fire!’
as grooms and gardeners forgot their usual respectful
reticence in the first flush of the anticipated
struggle with the direst foe of man and his
works.</p>

<p>‘There really is a fire, and I’m afraid a great
one, to judge by the smoke and the sparks,’ said
Lord Harrogate, who at this juncture entered.
‘My father has had his horse saddled already,
and has started by this time for the village, and
I am going too of course. I only came first to
see if’——</p>

<p>‘If we were ready to come too?’ cried Lady
Maud. ‘To be sure we will, the moment we
can get our hats, Gladys and I. Alice will stay
with mamma. We can’t work at putting out the
fire, but we may be of use somehow.’</p>

<p>And in an incredibly short space of time the
Ladies De Vere and their brother were hurrying
down the steep road that led to the scene of
the disaster. High Tor House, isolated and on a
lofty spot of rising ground, was in no sort of peril
from the fire raging beneath; but the indwellers of
the great mansion were not disposed, like the
divinities of the Pagan Olympus, serenely to contemplate
the woes of the inhabitants of earth, and
without waiting for orders, nearly every boy and
man in the Earl’s employ had hastened down to
fight the common foe.</p>

<p>‘The dry weather—unusually dry for this moist
district, where the last thing we generally have
to complain of is the want of rain—must help the
fire sadly,’ said Lord Harrogate, as the lodge-gates
were left behind, and the lurid light of the conflagration
became more and more distinctly visible
through gaps in the high hedges that bordered the
road. As they drew nearer, the eddying clouds of
smoke, mingled with fiery dots here and there, the
dull crimson glow, and the smothered sound of
voices mingling with the roar of the flames and
the clang of labour, gave unpleasant tokens of the
mischief that was going on.</p>

<p>‘I hoped at the first that the report was an
exaggerated one, as most reports are,’ said Lord
Harrogate, as they came in sight of the burning
houses. ‘But this is an ugly business. It is on
one side of the street only, by good luck, that
the fire is raging, and if we can keep it from
spreading’——</p>

<p>The crash of a cottage roof tumbling in, and
followed by a shower of sparks and small fragments
of flaming wood, drowned the rest of the
sentence. Matters were evidently bad enough,
though not quite so bad as might have been
augured from the first announcement of that
herald of misfortune, Bugles the butler. The
whole southern side of the long straggling street
was more or less in flames; and to keep the fire
from communicating itself to the houses on the
opposite side of the road was a work which in
itself taxed the strength of the whole adult male
population to the utmost.</p>

<p>The noise, the smoke, the falling sparks, and
the occasional plumping down into the dust of the
road of some half-consumed scrap of woodwork,
made Lord Harrogate’s sisters, who were physically
no braver than the average of their sex, shrink
back aghast.</p>

<p>‘Here, Maud!’ cried her brother impatiently.
‘We must not—or I must not—be drones in the
hive. You know most of these good people—Mrs
Prosser, for instance.—Mrs Prosser, my sisters will
stay with you while I go forward to bear a hand
in getting the fire under.—Where’s my father?
Ah, there he is, in the thick of the smoke!’</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, was dimly to be seen
the well-known figure of the old Earl giving orders
to such as were cool enough to hearken to them,
whilst his frightened horse, held by a groom, stood
at some distance. Darting through the clouds
of suffocating vapour, which were dense enough
to suggest the idea of a battle, Lord Harrogate
reached the place where his father was standing.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see any fire-engines!’ exclaimed the
young man, looking with a sort of dismay at the
chain of buckets passed from hand to hand.
‘What, in the name of all that’s wonderful, are
the people dreaming of?’</p>

<p>‘We have sent to Pebworth for help,’ said the
Earl, shaking his gray head; ‘but before any
arrives, if the wind freshens the houses will be
mere cinder-heaps. As for the parish engine,
Stickles here has got the same story to tell that is
only too common among us in England here.’</p>

<p>And Stickles, who was the clerk, rubbed his
hands apologetically together as he faltered out,
in reply to Lord Harrogate’s impatient question,
the excuses which he had previously addressed to
the Earl. The engine of which he was official
custodian had been long out of repair, and was
to have been ‘seen to,’ and should have been
‘seen to’ after harvest-time, had not the unfortunate
outbreak of a very real and practical fire
tested the unreadiness of the precautions for putting
it out. As it was, the only available means
of doing battle with the conflagration was the rude
and simple one of flinging water on the flames,
and at this task the inhabitants were busy enough.
They were busier, however, before long, as, under
the direction of Lord Harrogate, whom they
respected, they began to tear down some portions
of the burning buildings, in the hope of preventing
the fire from spreading. A strange sight it was
which the village street presented, encumbered as
it was by chests and bedding and the poor furniture
which had been hastily dragged out from the
doors of cottages now blazing, and the wailing of
frightened children, and the shrill voices of the
women, blended with the hoarse deep roar of the
triumphant flames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>{215}</span></p>

<p>‘’Tis a mercy, my lord, it broke out when it
did,’ said Charley Joyce, best bowler in the local
cricket club and best woodman in the Earl’s employment,
and in both of these capacities well
known to the Earl’s heir. ‘There’d ha’ been a
lot of us burned in our beds, if it had tarried
till after midnight. All came,’ he added, ‘of that
blessed rock-oil from Ameriky.’</p>

<p>Such indeed was the reported origin of the
disaster. A girl, for milking purposes, had taken
a tin lamp with her into a cowshed; the cow had
kicked over the lamp, and the burning petroleum
had set fire to the straw litter, whence the flames
had mounted to the thatched roof. Thatched
roofs, picturesque to look upon, were only too
numerous for safety in that West-country village.
The fire had crawled and darted, lithe as a serpent,
from gable to porch and from paling to stable.</p>

<p>‘There! Look at the school-house now!’ cried
a score of voices; and indeed the flames were
pouring outwards through the shattered windows
and licking the blackened walls, and withering to
charred sticks the pretty hedge where the fragrant
woodbine had clung so lovingly to the quickset,
and scorching the very flowers in the garden.</p>

<p>‘The fire began near about there,’ remarked
Joyce; but Lord Harrogate was already out of earshot,
since his keen eye had caught a glimpse of
a pale beautiful face, in the midst of the confusion
of the crowded street. He pushed his way through
the excited throng.</p>

<p>‘You are not hurt, Miss Gray, I hope and
trust?’ he said with an eagerness that surprised
himself.</p>

<p>‘No; but my house is burning,’ said Ethel in
reply; ‘and I am a stranger, and—— But pray,
my lord, do not trouble yourself to’—— For the
young man had drawn her arm gently but firmly
through his.</p>

<p>‘You must let me choose for you,’ he said. ‘My
sisters are here, close by, at Mrs Prosser’s, who
keeps the village shop—a kind motherly old soul.
I must leave you with them.’</p>

<p>Thus Ethel allowed herself to be led to the
place where, amidst a knot of women, whose awe-stricken
faces told how great was their interest
in the spectacle, the Ladies De Vere stood watching
the progress of the fire. Lord Harrogate did
not linger for an instant, but went back to put
heart into the men still battling with the encroaching
flames.</p>

<p>It was no trifle, this hand-to-hand combat, as
it were, with the fire; the fierce heat driving back
the volunteers who ventured very near to the
tottering walls to fling water upon the blazing
timbers, while the blinding smoke rushed volleying
out to blear the eyes and clog the lungs of the
workers, and ever and anon some tall chimney
or breached roof would fall with a crash, sending
showers of bricks and half-consumed wood into
the midst of the crowd; and hairbreadth escapes
were many and bruises numerous.</p>

<p>At last, however, the two engines from Pebworth
came clattering into the street, and water
being in that region of streams ready to hand,
and the wind happily abating, the fire was fairly
conquered, and all further danger at an end.
There was no loss of life; but some were singed
and many bruised; while thirty humble homes
had been turned to heaps of smouldering ruin,
and household gear and clothing, snatched from
the flames, formed piles here and there in the
wet road. Gradually the hospitality of this or
that neighbour afforded temporary shelter to the
crying children, the lamenting women, and the
exhausted men; while a flying squadron of boys
chased and led back captive the cows and pigs,
the fowls and donkeys of those whose yards and
sheds had been made desolate by the conflagration.</p>

<p>But what was Ethel to do? The old dame who
served her had been readily received into the
dwelling of a neighbour; and indeed nearly all of
those so suddenly evicted had kindred, and all
had friends to harbour them at this pinch. The
young school-mistress looked forlorn indeed, as
she stood alone in the midst of so many groups
of voluble talkers.</p>

<p>‘You must come home with us, Miss Gray,’ said
Lady Maud kindly; ‘must come up to High Tor
House, I mean,’ she added, seeing that Ethel did
not at first appear to comprehend her words, ‘and
stay with us until something can be done. It is
the least we can do for you, burned out of house
and home in this dreadful way, as you have been.’</p>

<p>Lady Gladys heartily seconded the invitation;
but Ethel still hesitated until the Earl drew near.</p>

<p>‘I have been telling Miss Gray here, papa,
that we will take care of her at the House for
a few days till she can look about her,’ said Lady
Maud.</p>

<p>‘Quite right, my dear,’ answered the Earl with
his fatherly smile; and thus the matter was settled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHINA_AND_MAJOLICA">CHINA AND MAJOLICA.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> love of china-ware still continues to be a
mania amongst certain classes in this country. In
the houses chiefly of the ‘upper ten,’ we see scattered
in lavish profusion little Dresden figures,
shepherds and shepherdesses, sweet, fresh, smiling,
fantastic little loves, leaning on impossible crooks,
or ogling us from under trees whose bowery
greenery embodies all that is idyllic in crockery.
Wonderful little old tea-cups, without handles,
transparent as an egg-shell, with no colouring to
speak of, faded, washed-out looking, are proudly
pointed to as almost priceless. From these our
great-great-grandmothers, in all the glories of
hoops and furbelows, are said to have drunk their
hyson and bohea in their great wainscoted and
tapestried rooms, discoursing as they sipped the
fragrant nectar, much as we their great-great-granddaughters
do still, over our afternoon tea; for the
world changes, but the human heart does not. All
manner of vanities go the round; trivialities of
dress or gossip; much tattling about the mote in
our neighbour’s eye, and a careful avoiding, with
commendable modesty, any reference even the
most remote to the beam in our own. These pale
transparent cups going their oft-repeated rounds
may have sown in their day the seeds of many a
pathetic commonplace tragedy or comedy, disseminating,
as they circulated around the board,
harmony and peace, or dissension and distrust.</p>

<p>Your true china collector has undoubtedly in
him something of the antiquarian Dryasdust spirit,
which loves to excavate and unearth the buried
treasures of the past; in his case, however, it is
gracefully blended with and overlaid by an instinctive
fondness for the tender, lovely, fragile
object of his regard. He knows, for he has often
anxiously weighed it, how frail it is. Every time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>{216}</span>
he looks at it he remembers the tumult of conflicting
emotions with which, once secured, he
packed it up with his own hands, and the fears
for its ultimate safety which tempered the ecstatic
pride of his triumph in the bargain which he had
just struck.</p>

<p>To the china-hunter, every object in his cabinet
or on his brackets is a trophy. That quaint old
enamelled <i>tazza</i> of Lucca della Robbia’s, he bought
in Rome; and as he gazes at it he thinks not so
much of the astute Jew dealer, for whom, as he
flatters himself, his own knowingness was fully a
match, but of a long-forgotten holiday, with its
bright days of sunshine, and the lengthening
purple shadows of night deepening over the
skies, and the grapes in ripe clusters on the
wall. How well he remembers their flavour still,
and the hand that plucked them for the stranger,
and the eyes that looked into his! What was her
name? He has forgotten it. What her fate? He
has never known. A most prosaic ending, truly,
to a vanished romance. But her charming grace
and beauty unforgotten, blend still in his memory
like a sweet rhythmical chant, and beautify with
a glory not altogether its own this rare old cup
of Lucca della Robbia’s.</p>

<p>With a sigh he turns from it to contemplate this
old plate of mezza-majolica. Opal-hued, iridescent,
it darts at him as he gazes upon it subtle flashes of
blue and yellow and ruby-hued flame, rejoicing his
soul with a deep unalterable conviction that it at
least is real. He acquired it in Urbino, many, many
years after he became the happy possessor of the
Lucca della Robbia cup. He paid a full price for it
too; but although a close man, he does not, and has
never regretted the imprudence. At the sight of
that beautiful plate, which he is pleased to call
unique, his charmed heart melts away into softness,
and his purse-strings begin to relax of their
own accord. It moves his spleen to see careless
visitors pass it by, as they sometimes do, to gaze
at the soft beauty of that bright yellow-robed
maiden, with dove upon her hand, who hovers
self-forgetful upon the very verge of a pea-green
china sea. The poor old quaint plate of mezza-majolica,
gleaming there like a veritable jewel,
is a treasure he jealously guards, and of its history
we would say a few words.</p>

<p>The Italian enamelled earthenware which became
famous under the name of Majolica, was first
produced in 1300 in a town in the duchy of
Urbino, which was under the feudal sway of the
Malatestas, who were lords of Pesaro. Vessels of
red clay such as had been long in use were
covered with a thin coating of white earth obtained
from the neighbourhood of Siena, and upon this
ground different coloured patterns were traced.
The vessels were then partly baked and covered
with lead-glaze, after which they received a final
firing. This delineation of coloured patterns upon
an opaque white substance was the humble germ
out of which the splendid many-hued majolica
ware grew.</p>

<p>The colours employed were usually yellow,
green, blue, and black; and the soft lead glaze,
which was easily affected by external influences,
imparted to the pottery that metallic iridescent
lustre which is the special characteristic of majolica.
To the Spanish Moors, this art was
also well known; and some of their beautiful
masterpieces finding their way into Italy, acted
as a fillip to the infant art, which long remained
swathed in rude and ungraceful swaddling-bands.
While it was in this transition state,
a new tin glaze was discovered, and applied to
terra-cotta bas-reliefs by the famous Lucca della
Robbia, and the lordship of Pesaro was sold to
the house of Sforza. The new feudal superiors
took an extreme interest in the potteries, and
granted such special privileges to the manufacturers,
that in a short time they succeeded in
making Pesaro famous for the production of majolica.
Early specimens of the ware manufactured
here are generally adorned with Moorish arabesques
and coats of arms. Heads of saints are
also a favourite study, and so are heathen goddesses;
while heads of the popes and Dukes of
Urbino abound, the name being affixed, to prevent
all mistake as to the portrait.</p>

<p>In the pottery of the Pesaro manufactory, the
outlines of the subjects are traced in black or blue,
and are in general correctly drawn; but the figures
are flat and hard, without a vestige of the breadth
and freedom which give such admirable life and
vigour to the etchings on the Greek vases; all
faults in design or execution being atoned for by
the marvellous beauty and finish of the glaze,
whose iridescent splendour has been equalled but
never surpassed by later artists. The most beautiful
specimens of this ware are due to the genius of
an obscure artist, whose very name has been forgotten,
who flourished in Pesaro about 1480. The
dishes he made were large and thick, and were
intended not so much for use as for display; as is
shewn by holes in a projection behind, through
which strings were passed in order to suspend
them from the wall. The colours he used were
blue and yellow, and they shone with a rare and
matchless mother-of-pearl splendour.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifteenth century tin enamel
had come into general use, and the potteries of the
duchy of Urbino had begun to manufacture a
finer majolica ware. The art may be said to have
reached its most palmy period. The finest qualities
of the old mezza-majolica were retained in the new
manufacture, and far greater artistic skill was displayed
in the painting and ornamentation. The
town of Gubbio acquired a world-wide fame by the
beauty of its lustrous majolica; and in the year
1485, Georgio Andreoli, a gentleman of Pavia, was
attracted to it. He was a painter and sculptor by
profession; and his majolica plates, glowing like
jewels with the richest and most brilliant colours,
are still famous. He excelled in the use of ruby
red and golden yellow, and his ware is generally
encircled by a brilliant flame-coloured border. He
delights also in the picturesque effect produced by
gold arabesques on a ground of vivid blue. His
period of greatest activity was from 1486 to 1537.
To china-fanciers he is known as the famous
Maestro Georgio of Gubbio, and his works now
command almost incredible prices. He is charged
with having made a secret of his metallic lustre,
and with having travelled about the country selling
his recipes to the highest bidder; but for this
charge there is no good ground. His brothers
and his son worked along with him, and they
had many assistants, to whom all the processes
of the manufacture were known. In the city
of Urbino, where Raphael was born, the manufacture
of majolica ware was carried on with great
spirit and success. Among the foremost of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>{217}</span>
ceramic artists of Urbino was a certain Orazio
Fontana. His designs, which are characterised
by great freedom and breadth of style, and
truth and fidelity of drawing, are likewise brilliantly
coloured and admirably glazed. One of
his masterpieces, a magnificent cup, in the possession
of Baron Rothschild, has his name inscribed
upon it; a frequent practice with the great Italian
potters.</p>

<p>All over the duchy of Urbino, potteries of this
ware flourished at Gubbio, at Pesaro, at Urbino,
and at Castel Durante. From these workshops
potters travelled with their secrets to other parts
of Italy and also to Flanders. The majolica of
Castel Durante is very beautifully finished; and
one of its principal manufacturers, Piccolo Passo,
wrote a treatise upon the art of making and
decorating majolica.</p>

<p>Faenza, which has given its name in France to
all soft pottery, also produced much beautiful
majolica ware. The Faenza majolica has, like
that of Urbino, a rich marzacotta glaze, and some
of the more ancient specimens are enamelled in
berettino, a pale-blue tint. The later Faenza
majolica is in style very like that of Urbino;
decorative and embossed embellishments are laid
aside, and pictorial designs are generally used.</p>

<p>Such is a brief sketch of an art for which
Raphael and Marc Antonio did not disdain to furnish
compositions, and whose masterpieces not
only found ready access into palaces, but were presented
to churches and hung up in cathedrals
during the middle ages as votive offerings to
saints.</p>

<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago I was brought by reverse of
fortune to form one of that vast number of women
in search of employment, the thought of whom
makes one’s heart ache as one looks at their numerous
applications for situations in the columns of
our daily papers. I had long been an orphan, but
not a penniless one, till a great bank-failure, such
as have from time to time brought so much misery
and embarrassment upon the middle classes of
society, swept away my little all, and left me
entirely dependent upon my own exertions for
future maintenance.</p>

<p>As the shock conveyed by the news of my
loss passed away, I was not in utter despair.
I had been well educated, was a tolerable musician,
and had travelled much; so it seemed to
me that I should have no difficulty in finding
a situation as companion or governess; and I
strove hard to conquer my natural shrinking
from the irksomeness of such a life, and to become
reconciled to my altered position. Friends
promised to help me, and for a time I depended
upon their promises. But finding that no situation
was forthcoming through their efforts, I
determined to try the effect of an advertisement
in the <i>Times</i>. I composed it with care, endeavouring
to set my qualifications in their best light,
and felt sanguine as to the result. I expected to
have at least a dozen responses, and was disappointed
at receiving only two. The first letter
I opened was in a woman’s handwriting, and consisted
of a string of impertinent queries, linked to
a statement of the writer’s requirements in the
governess she engaged for her daughters—requirements
which I felt sure I could never fulfil; winding
up with a request that if I felt equal to the
demands of the situation, I would call at a certain
address in the neighbourhood of Regent’s Park.
Such a letter checked my expectations, and with
some impatience I destroyed it. The next was
very different. It was a courteously worded note
from a gentleman, informing me that he was
seeking a governess, or rather companion, for
his ward, a girl of eighteen; and would be glad
to have an interview with me, if I would kindly
make such arrangements for one as would suit my
convenience. The tone of his letter pleased me,
and as he gave the address of an hotel not far
from the part of London where I was then residing,
I immediately wrote a reply, naming an hour
at which on the following day I would call upon
him.</p>

<p>It was with not a little trepidation that I set out
the next morning to fulfil my engagement. I had
the vaguest ideas of what I ought to do or say in
the new position in which I found myself, and
for which my previous experience had ill prepared
me. My heart sank within me as I inquired for
Mr Aslatt, and was conducted by a waiter to his
private room. Would the stranger be a very formidable
personage? I wondered. The first glance
at him was reassuring. A more benevolent countenance
I have never seen; and his tall stately
figure and genial though dignified manner, enhanced
the pleasing impression it created. He
was not a young man; but so bright was the
lustre of his steel-blue eyes, so full of life and
energy their glance, and his words and actions so
quick and lively, that no one would have thought
of calling him old, although his black hair was
streaked with gray, and his brow somewhat lined
by the cares and sorrows which come to all as the
years pass on. My fears vanished at his kind
reception, and I at once felt at my ease.</p>

<p>‘I do not know whether the services I require
will be to your mind, Miss Bygrave,’ he said;
‘but your duties will be very light. I wish to
obtain a sympathetic companion rather than
governess for my ward, Rose Sinclair, a young
lady of most lovable disposition, though high-spirited
and, I fear I must add, rather wilful. The
fact is she has lived with me ever since she was a
little child, and perhaps has been made too much
of—spoiled a little, you know. But she is so engaging,
so artless, so affectionate, no one could bear to
deny her anything. She has had masters and
governesses in abundance, but they have seldom
known how to manage her. She requires very
careful treatment; she may be led and guided, but
she will not be ruled. She has very good abilities,
but is averse to application. I have released her
from regular study; but I should be glad if you
could persuade her to read with you, and practise
her music and painting, for both of which she has
rare talent. Her position is a lonely one; she has
no one to depend on but me; and I am most
anxious to find for her a companion who might
prove a friend also. If you will excuse such a
remark from a stranger, I will add that your
appearance encourages me to hope that you would
prove such a one, if you were willing to try.’</p>

<p>Although Mr Aslatt offered me a far larger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>{218}</span>
salary than I could have expected, and assured me
of his desire that everything should be done to
make me comfortable and at home in his house,
I hesitated for some time before I accepted the
situation, for I rather doubted my ability to control
a high-spirited spoiled girl of eighteen. Her
guardian’s partiality for her evidently led him to
think lightly of the difficulties of the post he
offered me.</p>

<p>‘I think you cannot fail to be pleased with my
ward,’ he continued; ‘she is of such a noble disposition,
so generous and gracious; but as I have
said before, she needs to be gently checked, and
prevented from following all the impulses of her
young and ardent nature. I do not think you
would find much difficulty in managing her, if
you once succeeded in gaining her affection.’</p>

<p>‘But if I were not so fortunate?’ I said inquiringly.</p>

<p>Mr Aslatt smiled, and slightly shrugged his
shoulders. ‘I do not think we need fear that
alternative,’ he replied pleasantly. ‘But should my
hopes be disappointed, and the position prove distasteful
to you, you will be perfectly at liberty to
resign it whenever you please.’</p>

<p>I thanked him, and after a little more discussion
agreed to undertake the office of companion to his
ward.</p>

<p>Early in the following week I quitted London,
and proceeded to Westwood Hall, as Mr Aslatt’s
residence was named, a large country house,
situated in a neighbourhood not many miles from
the metropolis. I found a carriage waiting for me
at the quiet little station where I alighted from
the train. After a pleasant drive through pretty
country lanes, where the trees often met overhead,
we passed through some large iron gates,
beside which stood a picturesque lodge, and drove
through an avenue of elms to an old-fashioned
mansion in red brick. The building formed three
sides of a square, and in the space thus inclosed
were flower-beds of various shapes, brilliant with
many-hued flowers; and in the centre stood an
antique sun-dial upon a carved stone base, round
which, as I afterwards noted, ran in distinct letters
the motto, ‘Time is short; Death is nought;
Love is all.’ I had scarcely time to notice the
general surroundings of the place, before the
carriage stopped at the large oaken door.</p>

<p>Mr Aslatt had apparently been on the look-out
for it, for he met me with a cordial greeting before
I crossed the threshold, and led me into a large
oak-panelled hall which formed the centre of the
house. It was a curious apartment. The floor,
ceiling, tables, chairs, settee, were all of oak, and
most elaborately carved. The walls were decorated
with banners, shields, swords, helmets, and
various old family relics. Everything was old;
and I felt for a moment as if I had been suddenly
transported from the nineteenth century,
and carried back into the middle ages. But
though the oaken furniture was dark with age,
the hall did not strike me as gloomy, perhaps
because immediately on entering, my eyes rested
on the one bright object it contained. A girl was
seated upon the settee, whose bright golden hair
and dress of pale blue made a delightful spot of
colour amidst the prevailing sombreness. A large
black dog, of rather forbidding aspect, crouched at
her feet, but sprang up as I entered, and began
to bark furiously. ‘Quiet, Nero; quiet, sir!’ said
the young lady, without rising, while regarding
me with an intentness which made me flush.</p>

<p>‘Rose, this is Miss Bygrave,’ said her guardian;
and at his word she rose and moved slowly across
the polished floor to meet me, still surveying me
calmly and coolly with her large blue eyes, as if
anxious to arrive at a correct estimate of my character
and qualifications. She was tall and womanly
in figure, but wore her long golden hair in a cloud
over her neck and shoulders, merely confined by
a ribbon, as a child’s might have been. Though
a beautiful girl, she appeared unconscious of the
fact. Her regular clear-cut features were expressive
of self-reliance and determination, without
being in the least harsh or unfeminine. Her
manner was perfectly self-possessed, and her bearing
slightly haughty; but it was not long before
I discovered that underneath that appearance of
womanly dignity there was the simplicity and
waywardness of a very child.</p>

<p>‘How do you do, Miss Bygrave?’ she said
somewhat coldly, giving me her hand, and scanning
my face with a deliberation which I should
have resented from any one else, but to which I
now submitted humbly, as if it had been the right
of the proud young beauty who stood before me.
Then as if the result of her scrutiny were satisfactory,
she added more graciously: ‘I daresay you
are tired with your long drive; come, and I will
shew you to your room.’</p>

<p>I followed her up the wide staircase and along
a corridor to a room overlooking the extensive
garden which lay at the back of the house. I
was much pleased with the appearance of my bedroom.
From what I had seen down-stairs I was
prepared for an oaken chamber hung with tapestry,
with gloomy recesses, hearse-like bed, and ancient
furniture. Nothing of the kind, however, met my
view. Here everything was modern, and even
luxurious, and in such style as would have suited
the most fastidious taste.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will be comfortable here,’ said
Miss Sinclair.</p>

<p>‘It will be my own fault if I am not,’ I replied,
as I advanced to the window opening on to a
small veranda, from which steps led down into
the garden. ‘How pretty the garden looks!’ I
remarked. ‘I shall often feel inclined to walk
there, I fancy.’</p>

<p>‘You must not think of going there after sunset,’
said Miss Sinclair decidedly.</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>‘Because—— Well, perhaps I ought not to
mention it, for my guardian does not like it talked
about; and yet you would be sure to hear of it some
time or other, so I may as well tell you at once.
The truth is the house is haunted; not this part,
but the left corridor, where the rooms are very,
very old. And the ghost has been seen coming
out of the window of the Blue Chamber—which
communicates with the garden, as this does—and
going down the steps.’</p>

<p>I was astonished at the gravity with which she
made this statement.</p>

<p>‘You do not surely believe in ghosts, Miss
Sinclair?’ I asked. ‘You cannot really credit such
stories?’</p>

<p>She turned from me impatiently, saying: ‘It
is easy for you to doubt their existence; perhaps
if you had seen what I have, you would think
differently.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>{219}</span></p>

<p>‘What have you seen?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>But offended by my scepticism on the subject,
the young lady did not choose to reply. She drew
herself up proudly, and after inquiring if there
was anything I needed, left me to make my toilet.</p>

<p>Vexed with myself for having so soon given
offence to my charge, I strove for the rest of the
day to ingratiate myself with her; nor were my
efforts unsuccessful.</p>

<p>‘I think I shall like you,’ she said frankly;
‘that is, if you do not interfere with me too much.
I was dreadfully put out when Cousin told me
you were coming, for I like to be sole mistress
here. By the way, how do you like my guardian?
I always call him Cousin, although I do not at
all understand how we are related to each other.
I know nothing of my parents, except that they
died when I was a very little child. Cousin has
promised to tell me about them some day; but
he looks so grave whenever I refer to them, that
I fancy there must be something painful for me
to learn concerning my parentage, and therefore
I do not intend to ask any more questions. But
you have not told me how you like Mr Aslatt.’</p>

<p>I was amused at her eager curiosity, and told
her that although I had had so little opportunity
of judging, I had received a most favourable
impression of her guardian’s character and disposition.</p>

<p>She seemed pleased with my reply. ‘You can
have no idea how good he is,’ she said. ‘But he
is a man of strong prejudices, and it is hard to
move him when he has once made up his mind
with regard to any person or thing. Not that I
mean to find fault with him, for as far as I am
concerned I have not the least cause of complaint.
I cannot tell you how kind he is to me, or how
much I owe him. He is the best old darling
in the world!’</p>

<p>‘He is surely not so very old,’ I remarked,
smiling at her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think so?’ returned she. ‘He seems
quite old to me; but of course you are much
older than I am, and therefore judge differently
of age. Would you mind telling me how old
you are? I know it is very rude of me to ask,
but I always seem to do what I ought not.’</p>

<p>I laughed, and informed her that I was in my
twenty-eighth year.</p>

<p>‘Nearly ten years older than I am,’ she remarked,
‘and fourteen years younger than Mr Aslatt; so
you see he really is old.’</p>

<p>‘Not old for a man,’ I ventured to say.</p>

<p>‘Yes; he is,’ contradicted my companion impatiently,
shaking back her golden hair.</p>

<p>At this moment Mr Aslatt entered the room
in which we were sitting. ‘I have just been
thinking, Rose,’ he said, ‘that if it is fine to-morrow,
we might ride over to Ashdene. I daresay
Miss Bygrave would like to see the old Priory
there.—Are you fond of riding?’ he added, addressing
me.</p>

<p>It was long since I had been in the saddle; but
in earlier years I had exceedingly enjoyed the
exercise, and I told him so.</p>

<p>‘Then I hope you will enjoy a ride to-morrow,’ he
said. ‘I think I have a horse that you will like,
and Rose will lend you a riding-habit.’</p>

<p>I thanked him heartily; but Rose said decidedly:
‘I cannot go to Ashdene to-morrow; you
forget that it is my day for visiting the school.’</p>

<p>Mr Aslatt’s face changed, and a look passed
across it, which I should have called a look of pain
had not the cause been so trivial. ‘Surely you
need not go to the school to-morrow, Rose,’ he
said gently; ‘your visit is not of so much importance,
but that Mr Hammond can manage without
you for once.’</p>

<p>Rose’s face crimsoned and her lip pouted, but
she made no reply; and Mr Aslatt hastily introduced
another subject of conversation. But her
brightness was gone for the rest of the evening;
she replied shortly and coldly to her guardian’s
remarks, and flatly refused to sing when he asked
her to do so. It was evident that her conduct
grieved him, for the look of pain was more clearly
visible; but he shewed no sign of resentment, and
the tone in which he bade her good-night was as
affectionate as if her behaviour had been all that
he could have desired.</p>

<p>‘This is the way to the haunted rooms,’ said
Rose as we went up to bed together, opening as
she spoke a door at the top of the draughty staircase.
She raised her lamp, so that its light
rendered visible the gloom of the dreary corridor.
The air which met us had a close musty smell;
and the grotesque figures carved on the oak
panels, with the sculptures in the distance casting
dim shadows on the opposite wall, had rather a
weird appearance in the uncertain light. Suddenly
a door creaked on its hinges, and Rose
sprang back, uttering a faint cry, and hastily
closed the door which communicated with this
passage. ‘Did you hear that?’ she asked in an
awe-struck whisper.</p>

<p>‘Why, you silly girl,’ I said laughingly, ‘what
you heard was only the effect of the wind!’</p>

<p>She shook her head unbelievingly, and replied:
‘Well, remember, I warn you to shun that part of
the house, especially when night is coming on.’</p>

<p>The next morning, at an early hour, the horses
were brought to the door, and Mr Aslatt, Rose, and
I started for Ashdene. Rose had made no further
opposition to the expedition, and there was no
trace of vexation on her lovely face as we rode off.
She looked remarkably well in her riding costume.
The close-fitting habit of dark-blue cloth shewed
to advantage the exquisite symmetry of her figure;
and the little velvet hat, whose sole ornament
was a heron’s plume, was very becoming to the
fair face. She was an accomplished rider, and
controlled admirably, without the least appearance
of effort, the spirited movements of the beautiful
animal she rode. It was a bright May morning,
and the ride was most enjoyable. About noon we
reached the little town of Ashdene, where we dismounted;
and after partaking of some luncheon at
the hotel, proceeded to view the ruins of the old
Priory. Here we found so much to interest us
that the afternoon was far advanced before we
were ready to return. As we were walking our
horses up a hill not very far from home, I saw a
young man coming towards us dressed in a gray
tweed suit. As he came into view, Mr Aslatt
urged his horse into a canter; but Rose checked
hers as it quickened its pace, and said reproachfully:
‘The horses are tired, cousin; we must not
hurry them up this hill.’</p>

<p>As the young man drew near, he raised his hat.
‘Good afternoon, Hammond,’ said Mr Aslatt,
rather stiffly I thought.</p>

<p>How it happened I don’t know, but just then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>{220}</span>
Rose dropped her riding-whip, and it fell within
a few feet of Mr Hammond. He picked it up in
a moment, and handed it to the young lady, who
thanked him most graciously, and even bent down
from her saddle to shake hands with him. ‘I was
so sorry to be absent from my post to-day, Mr
Hammond,’ she said; ‘but we were tempted to
take advantage of this fine day for a ride to
Ashdene.’</p>

<p>‘It was a great disappointment to the scholars
not to see you,’ he replied; ‘but they have no
cause to complain, for it is so seldom you are
absent. I think you are if possible too devoted
to their welfare.’</p>

<p>‘That is my opinion too, Mr Hammond,’ interrupted
my employer; ‘and you must not be
surprised if for the future you do not see Miss
Sinclair so frequently at the school.’</p>

<p>‘I trust that will not be the case,’ exclaimed
Rose indignantly. ‘I see no necessity for changing
my habits.’ She looked quite angry as she
spoke, and I felt sorry for Mr Aslatt, he seemed
so agitated.</p>

<p>Mr Hammond smiled complacently at Rose’s
remark, and there was something almost supercilious
in his manner as he bade Mr Aslatt ‘Good
afternoon;’ but the bow and parting glance he
bestowed upon his ward were most deferential in
their admiring homage. As we pursued our way
in silence, the expression of Rose’s face plainly
shewed that she considered herself injured.</p>

<p>Mr Hammond was a good-looking young man,
apparently about thirty, though he might have
been older. Good-looking though he was, his
countenance did not impress me favourably. His
dark eyes had a hard look, in spite of their fine
shape and lustrous hue, and there were faint indications
of self-indulgence in the curves of his
mobile mouth. His manner was easy and suggestive
of conceit; in short, his appearance inspired
me with distrust. Perhaps the want of
cordiality which Mr Aslatt’s manner betrayed,
contrasting so vividly with Rose’s gracious greeting,
may have given rise to this feeling on my part.</p>

<p>Rose kept up an appearance of offended dignity
during dinner-time and as long as she remained
in Mr Aslatt’s presence. But as we were strolling
in the garden after dinner, she suddenly asked me
what I thought of Mr Hammond. Guessing that
she had a great liking for that individual, I was
guarded in my reply to her query, merely reminding
her how impossible it was to form a just
estimate of anybody in such a brief interview.</p>

<p>‘Did you notice how rudely Mr Aslatt spoke to
him?’ she next inquired.</p>

<p>‘I observed that he seemed impatient of the
interruption,’ I replied; ‘but I do not think his
words were rude.’</p>

<p>‘I believe he hates Mr Hammond,’ she said
quickly. ‘You cannot think how unjust he is to
him. You know Mr Hammond is the village
schoolmaster. There was no school in the village
many years ago, when Mr Aslatt came to reside
here, so he built a very nice school-house at his
own expense (I must take you to see it to-morrow),
and promised always to make up the master’s
salary to a certain sum. For years I have been
accustomed to go in and out the school whenever I
like; and when I asked to be allowed to give the
children a weekly singing lesson, Mr Aslatt made
no objection, indeed he seemed pleased for me to
do so. But since old Mr Green died, and Mr
Hammond succeeded him, he has changed his
mind on the subject, and can’t bear me to go to
the school-house. At first he seemed to like Mr
Hammond so much; but lately he has taken a
decided dislike to him; though what poor Mr
Hammond has done to call forth such a feeling, I
cannot imagine. Cousin has tried to persuade me
to give up my visits to the school; but that I
am resolved not to do, and I have told him so.
He also tried to get my consent to our removing to
London for the season; but I would not agree to
that. So then he could not rest till he had got a
companion for me. I made no opposition to that
plan, although I did not like the idea, for I saw
he had set his mind upon it, and I could not bear
to vex him. He is so good to me, and I am
not altogether ungrateful, though I do behave so
naughtily. I know you thought my conduct very
bad at dinner-time, for you looked so dreadfully
grave.’</p>

<p>She glanced up at me as she spoke with such a
pretty air of deprecation, so like a petted child,
that I could not find heart to scold her. Indeed
her captivating ways so fascinated me, that
although I saw much to disapprove, I was disposed
to be very lenient towards her faults.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SELLS">SELLS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would puzzle a philologer to give an exact
definition of the ‘sell.’ Nearly related to the
hoax, it differs from it in being more innocent in
its inception and less mischievous in its consequences.
Some little ingenuity is required to concoct
a happy ‘sell;’ but any one may perpetrate a
hoax who is equal to ‘lending a lie the confidence
of truth.’ The latter is a deliberately
planned deception, oftenest attaining its end by
personation or forgery or something closely akin
to it; whereas a sell needs no such playing with
edged tools, and may not only be unpremeditated,
but even unintentional.</p>

<p>The Irishman who undertook to shew an exciseman
a private still, and introduced him to his
brother, who had been twelve years in the army
and was a private still, sold the guardian of the
revenue very neatly; although it is possible the
victim of the joke did not see the fun of the thing,
any more than the official of the North London
Railway Company did, when, overhearing a third-class
passenger aver that any one could travel from
Broad Street to Dalston Junction without a ticket,
as he had done only the day before, he interviewed
him when he alighted. The traveller not proving
communicative, the zealous railway servant conveyed
a coin into his hand, and then asked: ‘How
did you go from Broad Street to Dalston Junction
yesterday without a ticket?’ ‘Oh,’ was the
unwelcome reply, ‘I walked!’</p>

<p>As readily trapped was the amateur musician
who responded to the advertisement: ‘Wanted,
a trombone-player for Barnum’s Balcony Band,’
by waiting upon the famous showman without
delay.</p>

<p>‘You want a trombone-player?’ inquired he.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mr Barnum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>{221}</span></p>

<p>‘What is the place worth?’ asked the applicant.</p>

<p>‘Oh, about twenty-five dollars a week, I
suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, I should like it.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said Mr Barnum; and the trombone
did frightful execution through the week.
Saturday came, and with it Mr Green for his salary,
instead of drawing which, he received a paper
on which was written: ‘Mr Green to Mr P. T.
Barnum.—To playing the trombone on his Balcony
one week, twenty-five dollars.’ The recipient
smiled.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right, isn’t it?’ asked Mr Barnum.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said the musician, ‘you’ve made an odd
mistake: you’ve made me the debtor instead of
you.’</p>

<p>‘No mistake at all,’ said Barnum. ‘You see,
this is how it is. There are a good many gentlemen
in this city fond of practising on brass instruments;
but they cannot do so at home because of
their neighbours’ objections. So I find them room
on my Balcony during so many hours a day, where
the street is so noisy that it does no harm; and
they give me so much a week for my trouble in
keeping the organisation complete. You don’t
think me such a fool as to pay such a wretched
lot of players surely? However, as you seem to
have been honestly mistaken, you can pay me ten
dollars this week; but hereafter I can make no
reduction.’ There was a vacancy in the Balcony
Band the following Monday.</p>

<p>We take it that the shrewd showman was not
quite so much astonished at the way his advertisement
was misconstrued, as one A. B., who, recognising
a long-lost friend in the stalls of the
theatre, but unable to catch his eye, notified in
the ‘agony’ column of the <i>Times</i>: ‘If the gentleman
who was in the stalls at the —— Theatre on
the evening of the 5th inst. will write to the following
address, he will hear from the Box above;’
and received nearly a score of replies. The first
he opened, ran: ‘<span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>—I cannot
express to you how delighted I felt this morning
on taking up the <i>Times</i> and reading your advertisement.
How exceedingly kind and thoughtful
of you to communicate with me in this way.
Pray, let me know as quickly as possible when
and where I may see you. I am burning with
impatience to speak to you. Can we meet this
evening? Do send me a note, or better still, a
telegram, here, on receipt of this.—Yours Most
Affectionately.’ The second letter, commencing
‘Mia Carissima,’ suggested a meeting at the Duke
of York’s Column, and ended: ‘Good-bye, pet.
Yours ever and a day—The Gentleman in the
Stalls.’ A third deluded mortal declared he had
not slept a wink after seeing A. B. at the theatre.
‘You know Who’ informed the ‘Dearest Being,’
whose himage he still saw before him, that his
passion was much too much for ordinary words to
tell; that after wandering all his life, mixing in
revolutions, &amp;c., he should like to stop at last,
and finished somewhat prosaically with: ‘It’s
just four o’clock. All are in bed and fast asleap.
Good-night. I’m not married.’ And so on with
a batch of other aspirants, who evidently deemed
the anonymous occupant of the Box nothing short
of an heiress.</p>

<p>Many an unpremeditated sell has been perpetrated
from inability to resist sudden temptation.
One of the judges of the Supreme Court
of New York state, visiting the Centennial Exhibition,
sat down in a quiet corner apart from
the others, to listen to a great cornet-player, and
as was his wont in court, drew his gray coat
about his head and ears as a protection against
possible draughts. His motionless figure soon
attracted attention; and the whisper ran that it
was the statue of some wonderful character. The
judge’s sister wickedly told those near her that
they were gazing at the effigy of an Aztec priest
from Mexico. The information passed from mouth
to mouth, and some hundreds of people were drawn
to the spot, to disperse somewhat sheepishly when
the object of their curiosity, having had enough of
the cornet, readjusted his coat and rose to go.</p>

<p>A good story is told of one Boggs, whose impertinent
curiosity was proverbial throughout the
country that owned him. He was on one occasion
travelling on the Little Miami Railroad alongside
a solemn-looking man, who persisted in looking
out of window and took no heed of Boggs’ endeavours
to enliven the journey with a little conversation.
At last the brakeman or guard came
round with some water, and the unsociable
traveller turned round to take a drink. Seizing
the chance, Boggs asked: ‘Going as far east as
New York?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ grunted the man.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Boggs, ‘New York is dull this time
of year; mebbee you’re striking for Philadelphia?’</p>

<p>The surly one shook his head.</p>

<p>‘P’raps Cleveland’s your destination?’ insinuated
Mr Boggs. ‘No? Can’t be going this roundabout
way to Chicago?’</p>

<p>No reply was vouchsafed.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ cried Boggs despairingly, ‘I s’pose you’ve
no objection to telling where you <i>are</i> going?’</p>

<p>‘Well sir,’ exclaimed the man, ‘I’m going for
seven years!’</p>

<p>Then the deputy-sheriff said he would rather
not have folks talking to his prisoners, and Boggs
gave in.</p>

<p>This puts us in mind of Mark Twain’s anecdote
of Artemus Ward and a travelling bore, between
whom the following amusing colloquy took place:
‘Did you hear that last thing of Horace Greeley’s?’</p>

<p>‘Greeley, Greeley, Horace Greeley; who is he?’
said Artemus.</p>

<p>Five minutes elapsed, then came: ‘George
Francis Train is making a good deal of disturbance
over in England; do you think they will put him
in prison?’</p>

<p>‘Train, Train, George Francis Train,’ said
Artemus solemnly; ‘I never heard of him.’</p>

<p>The tormentor tried another tack; he said:
‘What do you think about Grant’s chance for the
Presidency?’</p>

<p>‘Grant, Grant?—Why man!’ said Artemus,
‘you seem to know more strangers than any one
I ever saw.’</p>

<p>The man took a walk up the car; coming back,
he said: ‘Well, you ignoramus, did you ever
hear of Adam?’</p>

<p>The humorist looked up and said: ‘Adam?
What was his other name?’</p>

<p>The journey henceforth was made in peace.</p>

<p>Very nicely sold were a couple of tramps who
waylaid a wealthy farmer in Louisa County, Iowa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>{222}</span>
and demanded his money or his life. Disinclined
to part with either, he took to his heels. They
chased him half a mile down the roughest of lanes,
dashed after him through a brier-hedge, and went
panting across an old corn-field. Then the chased
one struck for the woods, and went wheezing up a
steep hill; his pursuers pressing closely behind
with blood-shot eyes and shortened breath. The
farmer dashed across a forty-acre stubble-field,
across a frozen creek, through a blackberry patch,
down a ravine, over another hill, across a stump-field,
to be run down on the road by the tramps.
They overhauled him thoroughly, searched him
from top to toe, to find he had not a solitary cent
wherewith to reward them for their perseverance.</p>

<p>Our concluding example relates to an affecting
romance told by the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. It was
the second time that the hero of the story had
accompanied the young lady home from one of
those little social parties which are got up to bring
fond hearts a step nearer to each other. When
they reached the gate, she asked him if he wouldn’t
come in. He said he would. Sarah took his hat,
told him to sit down, and left the room to remove
her things. She was hardly gone before her
mother came in, smiled sweetly, and, dropping
down beside the young man, said: ‘I always did
say that if a poor but respectable young man fell
in love with Sarah, he should have my consent.
Some mothers would sacrifice their daughters’
happiness for riches, but I am not of that sort.’</p>

<p>The young man started with alarm; he didn’t
know whether he liked Sarah or not; he hadn’t
dreamed of marriage.</p>

<p>‘She has acknowledged to me that she loves
you,’ continued the mother; ‘and whatever is for
her happiness is for mine.’</p>

<p>The young man stammered out: ‘I—I haven’t’——</p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind! Make no apology. I know you
haven’t much money, but of course you’ll live
with me. We’ll take in boarders, and I’ll be
bound that we’ll get along all right.’</p>

<p>It was a bad situation. He hadn’t even looked
love at Sarah. ‘I had no idea of’—— he began;
when she held up her hands saying: ‘I know you
hadn’t; but it’s all right. With your wages and
what the boarders bring in, we shall get along
as snug as possible. All I ask is that you be
good to her; Sarah has a tender heart, and if you
should be cross and ugly, it would break her down
in a week.’</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes stood out like cocoa-nuts
in a shop-window, and he rose up and tried to
say something.</p>

<p>‘Never mind about the thanks,’ she cried; ‘I
don’t believe in long courtships. The eleventh of
January is my birthday, and it would be nice for
you to be married on that day.’</p>

<p>‘But—but—but’—— he gasped.</p>

<p>‘There, there! I don’t expect any speech in
reply,’ she laughed. ‘You and Sarah settle it
to-night, and I’ll advertise for twelve boarders
straight away, I’ll try to be a model mother-in-law.
I believe I’m good-tempered and kind-hearted,
though I did once follow a young man
two hundred miles and shoot off the top of his
head for agreeing to marry my daughter and then
quitting the county.’ She patted him on the
head and sailed out. And now the young man
wants advice. He wants to know whether he had
better get in the way of a locomotive or slide off
the wharf. If ever a young bachelor was ‘sold,’
Sarah’s young man was in that predicament.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ELEPHANT_GOSSIP_FROM_RANGOON">ELEPHANT GOSSIP FROM RANGOON.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have much pleasure in laying before our
readers the following interesting particulars regarding
the elephant, and the way in which the
physical strength of that sagacious animal is
turned to account in the timber-trade of Rangoon.
The notes are contained in a letter from
a resident in that town to his brother in England,
who has kindly placed it at our disposal.
After describing some phases of every-day social
life, the writer thus proceeds: ‘The elephants
I go daily to see are beauties, fine powerful
well-trained animals, and strange to say, the
<i>mahout</i> (driver) of one of them is an old servant
of my own. It is both interesting and amusing
to watch them working the timber. The government
have nine elephants employed at the depôt,
and there are other animals belonging to natives
at work there also. I often take my seat on a
teak-log, picking out the cleanest and softest for
the purpose, light a cheroot, and watch the performance.
Elephants are pretty much like men;
I don’t mean in personal appearance, but in
character. I can pick out “characters I have
met” quite easily among the group of sixteen or
eighteen all working there together sometimes.
There are willing workers, and there are skulkers;
there are gentle tempers, and there are others
“as dour as a door-nail.” Some of them will
drag a log two tons in weight without a groan;
while others, equally powerful but less willing,
will make a dreadful fuss over a stick that is,
comparatively speaking, nothing.</p>

<p>‘There are a good many female elephants employed.
Some belong to the government; but
most of them are owned by Karens, who bring
them in from the jungle when work is obtainable.
They are not so powerful as the males; and the
want of tusks is rather against them, because they
have to do the pushing or “ounging” part of the
work, as the natives call it, with their trunks.
These they roll up in a coil, and just at the place
where the trunk and the head unite, they press
against the log and roll it over.</p>

<p>‘I saw the legs very nearly knocked from under
a man two days ago by a lively female who was
rolling over a log in this way. She had discovered
by experience that it was easier to move a heavy
log by a violent jerk than by slow steady pushing;
and when the man on her neck called out “Oung!”
and pushed her ear forward with his foot—the
equivalents in elephant-driving for “Go along, old
lady!”—she stood for a moment motionless, then
in an instant up coiled the trunk, down went
the head, and away rolled the log, one end of it
coming round with a sweep which all but made
an “Aunt Sally” of the innocent spectator. He
sprang from the ground as if he had received an
electric shock, and saved himself; after which he
received the congratulations of the by-standers for
being an ass to stand in the way of an elephant
like that.</p>

<p>‘I think the females do a little flirting sometimes
when they see a handsome stately <i>tusker</i> working
near them. A little one came in from the jungle
the other day, and was working away with admirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>{223}</span>
diligence near the place where my largest
elephant was engaged dragging logs. He is really
a noble-looking animal, with immense tusks that
almost touch the ground when his head is in
repose. There is a dignified air about all his
movements too which must be very captivating
with the other sex. Sometimes the two passed
very near each other, and I noticed when this
happened that the little lady from the jungle gave
utterance to certain peculiar sounds. The only
good imitation of them which I can think of at
the moment is that strange medley of incoherences
which a cornopean is sometimes made to produce
when beginners get up steam. Such sounds,
for instance, as I have heard proceeding from the
house of a neighbour of yours, when I have been
enjoying a pipe in the garden on a summer
afternoon. At first I thought they were the
promptings of fear; but an elephant under these
circumstances generally becomes impatient with
the driver, thumps its trunk upon the ground
and “trumpets.” It was simply a little flirtation,
a tender long-drawn-out elephantine kiss thrown
at my noble friend.</p>

<p>‘The highly trained male elephants with tusks
manage the “ounging” part of their work very
skilfully. The trunk is used as a pad or buffer
between the ivory and the wood, and the pushing
is done steadily. An average log weighs about
a ton and a half. When it has to be pushed into
the river, the elephant feels the end of it with his
trunk, and having ascertained where he can place
his tusks with most advantage, he adjusts the
buffer, and starts off pushing the log steadily
before him. Should it happen to be an extra-heavy
one, he stops occasionally to take breath;
and as it slides down the muddy bank towards
the water, he gives it a finishing slap, as if to say:
“There, you’re afloat at last!” Sometimes the
logs are awkwardly jammed up together, so that
the ends have to be raised in order to get the
dragging-chains fastened. This he does by putting
his tusks underneath; and passing his trunk
over the log to keep it steady, lifts it up to the
required height. When it is a very heavy lift, he
will go down on his knees to get a better purchase.
He stacks the timber most skilfully also by lifting
the end of the log as much as nine or ten feet in
this manner, places it on the top of the pile, then
goes to the other end and pushes it forward
till he gets it quite flush with the rest. In all
this he is of course directed by his rider the
<i>mahout</i>, who uses certain words which the elephant
has been accustomed to hear; and signs,
the meaning of which he knows perfectly. A
push of the foot behind the right or left ear
makes him answer the driver’s wish as a boat
answers the rudder, and a nudge behind the
neck means “Straight ahead.”</p>

<p>‘A highly trained elephant, however, will work
among timber by <i>verbal</i> directions as intelligently
almost as a collie will among sheep. The finest and
best-trained animals are reserved for employment
in the saw-mills, where they work amongst the
machinery with sagacity and precision. Strangers
have sometimes been so much impressed with
their admirable qualities in this respect that they
have carried away slightly exaggerated impressions
on the subject. One case I remember in
which a spectator was so profoundly overcome by
the careful manner in which he saw the elephant
laying planks and slabs on the travelling benches
to be cut, that he gravely reported the circumstance
in an Indian newspaper, remarking that the
animal shut one eye when it looked along the
bench, to make sure the timber was laid on for
the saw accurately!</p>

<p>‘Some male elephants have no tusks. These are
called <i>hines</i> by the Burmese. The most powerful
animal I ever had was one of them. He was very
tall, and in strength a perfect Samson among
elephants. An incident in his history is worth
relating here, as I am on the subject. In the
month of January male elephants sometimes give
trouble. Samson had fallen into a capricious mood,
under the influence of a little siren belonging
to the herd, and in a fit of jealousy he frightened
all the others so thoroughly one night that they
broke their fetters and made a bolt of it out of
the timber-yard, with Samson in pursuit. One
unfortunate member who was on the sick-list at
the time and had an impediment in his walk, was
bowled over and trampled on several times, and
was never fit for anything but the hospital afterwards.
The others took to the jungle, and it cost
some money to recover them. Samson remained
in possession of the timber-yard for three whole
days, no living thing daring to venture near
him.</p>

<p>‘I have watched a fowl that had thoughtlessly
gone to scrape for its morning meal on the accustomed
spot in the rear of the elephant-shed, run
for its bare life, with Samson after it at full speed,
trunk and tail extended! Crowds of people used
to collect daily, most of them at a highly respectful
distance however, to witness the giant keeping the
world at bay. Sometimes an adventurous native,
out of pure mischief would approach within thirty
yards or so of him spear in hand, when Samson
would thump his trunk upon the ground and rush
at the intruder, who soon disappeared under the
nearest verandah. The poor animal was helpless
against such tactics. They were to him what the
deprivation of sight was to his prototype; but the
desire for revenge was there still, and he tried his
strength upon the posts of the building, attempting
to push them down. When he had failed in this,
he deliberately set about unroofing it with his
trunk; whereupon the tormentor pricked his legs
from underneath the house with his spear, and
made him desist. After carrying on this game till
he got tired, he walked off with his companion one
night to the jungle, and selected a spot for his
future residence close to a mud-pool.</p>

<p>‘For some days he made raids upon the adjoining
gardens, eating up the fruit-trees without
compunction; and in revenge for some opposition
he met with from a market-gardener who did not
appreciate his new neighbour’s high-handed way
of doing things, levelled his hut to the ground.
Things were beginning to get serious. Claims for
damages became unpleasantly frequent, and it was
absolutely necessary to put a stop to his depredations.
Accordingly, I sent out a deputation of
elephants to wait upon him, with picked men as
drivers and attendants, for the purpose of bringing
him to reason. There were ten elephants altogether,
the senior member being a very patriarchal-looking
animal with an immense pair of
tusks—the one, in fact, who was always employed
to settle difficulties among the juniors; and in this
capacity he had been uniformly successful. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>{224}</span>
the deputation arrived at the spot, Samson was
enjoying his morning bath in the mud, and they
surrounded him. The patriarch, with the chief
<i>mahout</i> driving, and another good man and true
behind him, for the purpose of supplying any
lack of moral courage that might manifest itself
under trying circumstances, was taken nearest to the
renegade. His sweetheart was quietly browsing
among the bamboos close by. The moment Samson
realised the situation, he made a rush from the bath
at the patriarch, who forgetting his wonted dignity
of manner, turned tail and bolted. The hook
and the spear with which the drivers were armed
alike failed to restore courage to the leader. On
he went, tearing through the jungle, the branches
of trees and thorny creepers making sad havoc
with the persons of the men on his back. His
bad example demoralised the whole force; they
fled for their lives every one of them. At last it
came to be a race between Samson and the patriarch,
the other elephants having made lateral tracks
for themselves and got clear of danger. When it
came to close quarters between the two, the <i>mahout</i>
thinking discretion the better part of valour, laid
hold of the branch of a tree as he passed and
held on, leaving the other man to his fate. In
a very short time he too was unseated, but in
an involuntary manner; the elephant shot under
the branch of a tree which did not afford space
for the man to pass under as well, and he was
swept to the ground. He was able, however, to
elude the pursuer, who was so eager to get at
the four-footed fugitive that he took no notice of
the fallen rider as he crawled along into the
thick jungle.</p>

<p>‘Fortunately no life was lost in this most exciting
adventure. Even the patriarch got off scot-free.
When tired of the pursuit, Samson returned
to his rural retreat. The deputation got home in
the evening, more frightened than hurt. I administered
chlorodyne with much success to those
whose bruises and lacerations bespoke a sleepless
night; and it has since been regarded as a specific
for patients suffering from cutaneous diseases and
nervous excitement.</p>

<p>‘But I have not done with Samson yet. He was
a valuable elephant, and I was most anxious to
recover him. I offered a reward of two hundred
rupees (twenty pounds) to any one who would
bring him in; and a few days afterwards he came
marching into the timber-yard as gentle as a lamb,
with a young lad astride on his neck. This youth
was the son of the man from whom I had purchased
him, and the boy had been familiar with
the animal from his childhood. Hearing of the
reward that was offered for the apprehension of
his old pet, he set off in quest of him. When he
found him, he made use of the terms with which
Samson had formerly been familiar. There was
no longer any difficulty. The youth took him
by the ear, told him to give him a leg up—the
usual way for <i>mahouts</i> to mount their steeds—and
immediately Samson was himself again. Next
day he was on duty, looking as if nothing had
happened, and his little friend was the possessor
of a reward which to him was a small fortune.
Such is the affinity between God’s creatures which
the law of kindness establishes. The little fellow
had really more power in the tones of his voice
over the huge animal than a phalanx of its own
species under the direction of a score of men!</p>

<p>‘There are elephants that have naturally one
tusk only. These are called <i>tays</i> by the natives
here. When the single tusk happens to be
on the right side of the head, literally as well
as metaphorically, and the animal otherwise is
large and well proportioned, he is greatly prized
by the native princes of India. They seem to
regard him with veneration, as the Burmese do the
so-called white elephant. There is one of these
<i>tays</i> at the depôt at present. He is the largest
and most powerful animal in the government herd;
but age is telling upon him, and now he is chiefly
occupied in doing “the heavy-father” amongst the
youngsters. When they have tried their best
and given up in despair some log which none
of them can drag, the <i>tay</i> is brought to the
front, his chain is fastened to it, and as he walks
off, apparently without inconvenience to himself,
be it ever so heavy, his eye really seems to have
“Bless you, my children!” &amp;c. in it. I have
watched him often, and I think my interpretation
of his feelings is pretty nearly correct. I was
told by the superintendent of the depôt that native
princes had sent messengers from India to try and
purchase this elephant for state purposes, offering
as much as five thousand rupees for him; but he
has a value where he is which does not consist in
a superstitious veneration for his single tusk, but
in the virtue which lies in a friend in need.’</p>
